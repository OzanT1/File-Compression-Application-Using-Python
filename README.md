# File-Compression-Application-Using-Python
The project uses LZW algorithm to compress and decompress image files and text files. I used Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image
processing and used NumPy library to work on matrices. Finally, I used Tkinter to implement a GUI. "imageCompressMain.py" is the program with a GUI. Run this if you want a GUI. 
If you run "main.py", the program will compress and decompress the example text file "text.txt". Use .bmp files for image compression and "thumbs_up.bmp" is there for an example .bmp file.
